# OS scheduler
## 1. Introduction
This project is a simulation of the OS scheduler. The scheduler is responsible for scheduling the processes in the ready queue. The scheduler is implemented using the following algorithms:
- Non-preemptive Highest Priority First (HPF).
- Shortest Remaining time Next (SRTN).
- Round Robin (RR).
